**Prerequisites**
Before running the project, the following tools need to be installed:
1. Node.js: Vite requires Node.js to run, so you should install Node.js if dont don't have it already. Download Node.js here  (https://nodejs.org/en)
2. VS Code: You should have Visual Studio Code installed to view and edit the code. Download VS Code here. (https://code.visualstudio.com/)



Once the zip file has been downloaded for the files shared, then extract the files. 
It will look something like the following:

Note that the files are saved in folder called "Geographical-Quiz-Website-main" in my case. You can name you folder whatever you like

Then open VS Code and follow the following steps:
1.Open the project folder by navigating to File > Open Folder and selecting the project directory.
2.Then go to Terminal in the tool bar and select "New Terminal" and ensure that the correct directory path is selected. In my case it looks like:

Once the above steps have been followed,  web app can be viewed by running the following in sequence specified below:
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npx serve -s dist

Then something similar will show:
<img width="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/febd131b-c580-46a7-9c34-42668a265e02" />
Type "http://localhost:3000" in your browser to view the website or whatever is showing against "Local" in the terminal
